<h3>2024-01-05 13:32</h3>

<p>It's the start of the blog, yaay!</p>

<p>How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.</p>

<h3>2024-01-06 21:36</h3>

<p>Everything is crazy, homesick at home yet I wanna leave so bad! Tomorrow big
time! (<em>added Spotify links, songs everywhere! Good job past me</em>)</p>

<h3>2024-01-07 21:09</h3>

<p>üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (<em>glad for Eva</em>). Room needs small improvements (<em>bigger
ones wouldn't fit</em>). </p>

<p>Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? </p>

<ol>
<li>How is everyone going to be.</li>
<li>How lost am I going to be.</li>
<li>I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.</li>
<li>What is the golf course like! :D</li>
</ol>

<p>Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!</p>

<h3>2024-01-08 20:56</h3>

<p>What a long day ha! </p>

<p>8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).</p>

<p>Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with Amy the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. </p>

<p>Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, Magda showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.</p>

<p>Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (<em>some state of the art
html source</em>). And some simpler Python thingies.</p>

<p><img src="images/globe_cern.jpg" alt="globe" width=40%></p>

<h3>2024-01-09 16:12</h3>

<p>Hey there! Bunch of mails done today, M. is pouring info and there's still more
to go. Went to the 275 lab this morning, saw mountains for pretty much the
first time (<em>the view is much much better than what I expected</em>). Had small
debugging session with A., had zoom calls about bunch of guys speaking
french..., lunch and more debugging. </p>

<p>A. gave me access to the <strong>universe</strong> amount of data (<em>like wtf is in 19PB of
experimental data and WHY THE FUCK is it in single folder somewhere AND WTF AM
I DOING WITH ACCESS TO IT IN CLOUD!!!</em> ... like, I'm not touching anything but
just saying). </p>

<p>Did some search for the problem, helped to solve it finally after she was stuck
on it for weeks probs. God I hope I'm gonna be useful here (that felt nice)!
She's probably gonna let me fiddle around with much more from that one so I
should try to read up on electromagnets lul.</p>

<p>About hour more and home we go.</p>

<p>Also... got mail from M. that we are advised to go home and work remotely
because of the snow :D Interesting.</p>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1rBiNR61IhvbzeKwfs3AwE?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>Also this is playing on repeat :D</p>

<h3>2024-01-09 23:22</h3>

<p>Well I wanted to go working out to Bushido Gym. Such a nice place and the guy
does only 1on1 sessions. Bummer. Gotta get on the bike thing tomorrow (not
literally yet). </p>

<p>Looks like I'm gonna be learning javascript for web dev project. So even this
website might get a facelift who knows.</p>

<p>Well GN and let's try for a gym tomorrow after work!</p>

<h3>2024-01-10 23:53</h3>

<p>Good evening! Day pretty much successful. I am pretty active in helping A. with
the project. And she's having problems with such basic stuff (not meant bad,
she is not supposed to do better, she did great already with the amount that
she has written). But I feel like I could help more. Still feels good that I
can solve whatever she throws at me.</p>

<p>I was told that I might be able to participate during some of the ZULF
experiments if there is gonna be python shenanigans happening! That would mean
going to the Geneva hospital and doing something around their own small
accelerator!! Cool!</p>

<p>Started working on the website. Pain. Gonna continue tomorrow.</p>

<p>First time visiting the gym here! Gotta search for another one, because this
one costs a lot (25 CHF per visit/125 I think per month). Could do montly, but
would probably be better to look elsewhere too. Did chest, 100 bench 2x, 1x,
bunch of 90, 80. NOBODY KNOWS ANY ENGLISH, WTF!!! Was spotting the younger guy
who spoke only french. Like cmon learn some english as well, what are you
doing. Was happy with how it went tho.</p>

<p>Shower + Sleep! Cy@</p>

<h3>2024-01-11 23:33</h3>

<p>Day that went away quite quick! Work was great, I'm useful there and there are
more projects to come.</p>

<p>Spending time with A. on the project, I would like to help more but not forcing
anything. I mean it's still a project that funds everything that she does here.
So surely she wants to work on it by itself.</p>

<p>WTF that powerlifting belt. There were some visible hints but that's so cool!
Gonna have to try the CERN gym xD</p>

<p>P.S. Don't try the burger again! It's really not worth the money.</p>

<h3>2024-01-12 22:50</h3>

<p>First friday, first weekend incoming. The week went by super fast. Spent the
day struggling with the website kinda, but got a lot of progress in. I would
just hope to code it up all by myself. But first reactions were nice. Got the
<em>views</em> going at the end so it now seems like I know what I'm doing. Found out
that A. had the phd done in Oxford from what it looks like, just wow.</p>

<p>Have seen the french mountains clearly for the first time!</p>

<p>Great to talk to that Netherlands guys. Also Monika was one to talk to as well.
Probably gonna work with her more during the Vito web dev. Also stoked about
the next task (hopefully CERN approves it - learning JavaScript gonna be
interesting but not as hard I think).</p>

<p>I was the luckiest, late registering for the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330090/">BBC podcast
event</a> and was able tob participate!
What a lucky thing, like 800 people with really well known faces in the front.
And most of the audience were CERN guys xD That's some audience as well (I
really gotta get my own trip to the LHC done, because that would be a shame not
actually seeing the big stuff). </p>

<p>Adding some images from the podcast event and on my way home: (also the gallery
idea is not really bad - could use the slick library I found out about)</p>

<h3>2024-01-13 23:14</h3>

<p>First saturday, first walk through Geneva, first shopping madness at the end of
work day in coop. Geneva was cosy, not big, walkable. French is everywhere!
People actually don't know much english. I started doing french duolingo course
xD. Tried going to the Saint-Genis gym. Man they should really know a bit of
english everywhere... </p>

<p>Geneva was nice, look at some of the nice images.</p>

<p>Sunday is about trying to find suitable gym. I already know about a boulder gym
and that is gonna be a plan for sometimes next week probably. We'll see what's
the program. Also I should look at those indico events, because there might be
something interesting that I'm missing.</p>

<h3>2024-01-14 18:40</h3>

<p>Soo no workout today, weird membership rules so a new member cannot go anywhere
just to try it once. Swiss people actually don't work on weekends.
But I was fortunate enough to have a <strong>bouldering gym</strong> pretty close in Geneva.
And that's gonna be a great place where to spend some time (even on Sundays!).
Light blues and one dark blue done today. Although I was getting embarassed by
climbing kids as always. Talked a bit to these two in CERN student girls and
they were great. One was getting seriously close to embarassing my climbing
too. But luckily I showed off well.</p>

<p><img src="images/boulder.jpg" width=40%></p>

<p>Not gonna work much more today. Will get a dinner in. And probably look at some
javascript thingy so I know what I'm getting myself into or I try to look for
some ways how to try and solve the ssh connection task.</p>

<p>Also I saw mountains on both sides for the first time! What a moment. The area
is much mountain-y than what I've expected.</p>

<h3>2024-01-16 00:10</h3>

<p>Hey there. Just one late entry before the bed. Had my first monday report
today. Felt like I was looking for words but it went ok. A. is giving me more
programming tasks. </p>

<p>I became the master of cernoverride theme and hence the master of css. The site
is gonna look good! I never knew the strenght of nautilus mounting. </p>

<p>Also went for the Bladonet nonstop gym and that's probably gonna be the gym to
stay in. My legs are so sore! 140 squats without belt for twos. Felt really
good. Place bit crowded but it never really stopped me from doing my stuff.</p>

<h3>2024-01-16 15:55</h3>

<p>This day takes so long, maybe because I'm basically alone here. Meeting is
coming up shortly. I've done some good work today, the DB is waiting for
approval, been running around asking questions and making stuff done. Will
finish the day with looking at c++ resources for A.</p>

<h3>2024-01-16 23:21</h3>

<p>OK so the meeting was really something. It was a safety meeting mainly because
of the fiery 24/10 incident with Ita. girl (the name of whom I'm still missing). 
It looked rough for everyone because of the safety procedure changes that have
to happen. It didn't sound that unreasonable, but I can imagine that those
clever minds can think of something just on the spot (<em>just as I do while
working</em>) that really has to be done in the moment and this kinda sabotages
their work.</p>

<p>Hopefully they get together to generate something that helps everyone and
doesn't threaten ISOLDE anymore.</p>

<p>Lidl shopping is goated. First chicken breasts today xD. Loved that. Would use
some more cutlery, but I managed.</p>

<h3>2024-01-18 00:41</h3>

<p>An interesting day. I was pretty useful, almost finishing the N. visualizer
project. Ending the day with actual python script generating real time data for
the DB and visualizer working as intended. Probably gonna implement it
tomorrow.</p>

<p>In next few days, I'm gonna talk to M. about the website so I'm a bit nervous
but I think we will manage together.</p>

<p>I really like how much I need to go around and communicate with others, because
I always feel like I know only half of the needed informations. And it's kinda
like a game, figuring out all the necessary pieces to put together. Real team
work feeling kinda. </p>

<p>I opened my SWISS BANK ACCOUNT üá®üá≠ today! What a weird student's life this is.
This is like a whole adventure. I'm glad that I'm keeping up with this blog.</p>

<p><img src="images/ubs.jpg" width=40%></p>

<p>Finished my day with gym, chest day. I kept my strength mostly. Why are there
only 37.5kg dumbbells in the gym. I was already repping that. We'll have to do
some harder exercises with those ones. Other than that, I looked PEELED AF.</p>

<h3>2024-01-18 13:08</h3>

<p>Afterlunch one. Tasks flying, zoned out with the website, N. comes in with
Python requests. Still making improvements on website. Now gotta prepare the
final version of everything for visualizer. It's like a game. Need to <em>minmax</em>
all of it.</p>

<p>Started talking a lot with most of the guys at lunch. Feels like I'm slowly
getting tag of the <em>regular</em> one and kinda a part of team member.</p>

<h3>2024-01-18 23:13</h3>

<p>Evening entry. We have the test visualizer running :D My man is pumping it with
data 2 random doubles + time code + maybe something else every 200ms. We
already have some improvements for it and there are guys in the office looking
to get something of their own plotted as well. I might set them up for
something too.</p>

<p>Finally bought a cutting board, the living conditions are slowly but surely
improving. Also, found use for my first lessons level french in shape of <em>Cheval
steak</em> in Carrefour üê¥.</p>

<p>Also, this song might be a theme of this whole trip. It came out like a day or
two after my arrival and I'm completely hooked.</p>

<h3>2024-01-19 23:45</h3>

<p>End of the second working week. Clouds went finally away and it look awesome!
<strong>TODO: add some pics!</strong> Also tried to get the bike sorted but that went south
real bad. How does an atm not have enought money... </p>

<p>The visualization app is running, although there is a problem on upload (not on
my side I think). And I had meeting with M. about the website and we finally
have some contents for it. She has some really ambitious ideas for it. I'll try
whats possible.</p>

<p>I'm going to look for some trips around the area. Gym tomorrow for sure!</p>

<h3>2024-01-20 17:22</h3>

<p>I'm home from a first little trip of mine to Jura mountains. And I'm so glad
that I went. It was pretty cheap and quite easy to get to the mountains. Most
of the time I was choosing pretty nonsense tracks for myself. It was a weird
feeling being there just on my own. Felt kinda awkward for a bit. Gotta add
some of the pictures. </p>

<p>I'm gonna go for a night gym session later.</p>

<h3>2024-01-22 10:56</h3>

<p>No entry from yesterday, but mainly because I did almost nothing. Free day is
fine as well (probably). Listened to some IT stuff, I feel like doing some kind
of GPU raymarcher or voxel engine of some sort with physics and raycasting
(<em>yeah influenced by teardown for sure</em> - <em>imitation is the greatest form of
flattery</em>). </p>

<p>Called with ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è as always! I'm glad for her.</p>

<p>Also played around with this blog. Now know how I'm going to do img galeries,
it's now just a matter of choosing nice way of implementing it - struggled with
picture height/widht.</p>

<p>And I've started watching a bit of netflix in the evening! xD Started the <em>Full
swing</em> series about golf (drive-to-survive-like). And I was very impressed. So
I'm probably gonna look at that more.</p>

<p>NOW... It's Monday my dudes. Actually I'm really happy at work! Looks like some new
projects are slowly coming my way. We just had meeting with A. and M.
presenting their projects. A. measuring interfacial ionic conductivity in SSB
was like just beyond what I could have understand. But I think with couple of
searches I might get on top of that and it really sounded like a big great
thing. Actually a project where I can see a work on something tangible
(althought, nm of ssb xD). But it looks like some future tech which I would
have no clue about otherwise. Glad to be here with them.</p>

<p>Gotta go work on line fitting c++ before the lunch guy comes :D (muffin man:
the lunch man).</p>

<h3>2024-01-23 00:23</h3>

<p>Another Monday. What an eventful day! Got my credit card (made of cornstarch
for some reason). After last entry we almost immediately had lunch, I went to
work for a minute and Marius was heading away with Daniel to CMS for friendly
excursion. And stuffed happend and they had one free spot which he gave to me.
I'm so greateful. That was amazing. Gotta add some pics later <strong>TODO: pics</strong>.</p>

<p>Stuff like science fiction. 100m underground, built on top and with crane took
to the cavern. Crane was used to build the South African(I think) football
stadium roof in one piece. Detector was huge and we saw it move. On freaking
howercrafts xD ...scientists man (I'm kinda part of them). What a job to have.
Guys looked like regular technicians but must be so into what they are doing
and on another level. We also got to see mockup of the LHC tube which gave me a
better idea of what and how it actually works.</p>

<p>Got some work done in the end of the day. Ahhhh got my bike (#2277) this
morning! 100 CHF deposit well spent :D It looks sick! </p>

<p>And did a evening (late evening) workout. It all feels great, but could be
better in there. Maybe in the next days.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<h3>2024-01-23 23:43</h3>

<p>Well today was more about programming than any other day xD I was deep in C++
the whole day. Trying to figure out how to compile those three libraries
together. Line fitting is gonna be in my dreams now. However, I think I figured
what I could do to make it work. Gonna be another day of cpp and that's fine!!!</p>

<p>Other than that I was fairly lazy. We watched another Black Mirror episode (I
think one of the worst episodes tbh). Bought some stuff for mornings, kikoman
for the rice and more pasta :P. Miss ü¶Ü.</p>

<p>The bike is amazing tho. I almost came late for work because I just knew how
fast it's going to be.</p>

<h3>2024-01-24 22:46</h3>

<p>Quite a long day because I made it that way xD. Had a lot of fun with C++ in
the past two days. Have been working for A. on her line fitting and it just
couldn't compile together. So I tried to do my idea from yesterday and it
worked. Self-contained my ass, now it is truly self contained... Producing 3.5k
lines in 2 header and 1 cpp files. BUT it works without any need for some fancy
special compilation. Great! A. seems to like the outcome. Quick scripting
around and we were plotting different spectra left and right!. </p>

<p>Quick cycle home and back for gym. Quite a strong back, but cannot shake that
idea that I lost size in the back. We'll see.</p>

<p>I was able to get a place at ATLAS guide for this friday and ALICE with Lisa
for early February! I'm probably gonna be able to see all the experiments I was
looking forward to!</p>

<h3>2024-01-25 23:50</h3>

<p>First half of the day great, second half meh. At least of the work part xD. 
Did some improvements for C++ and I loved the way it turned out. Everyone is on
safety procedures so I wasted some time with the website (<em>gotta add the content
first before making it look pretty!!</em>).</p>

<p>The weather is finally getting better! We get full days of at least partly blue
skies! So mountains are always visible and the bike rides are amazing.</p>

<p>Made some calls and did some bouldering afterwork. I moved up to a higher tier
(dark blue me)! Still there are so many better climbers that do it so easily xD
it's insane!</p>

<p>Friday next!</p>

<h3>2024-01-27 19:24</h3>

<p>No entry yesterday. Just because I was so tired in the evening I was happy to
persuade myself to go to bed. Friday was pretty sick (in a good way). Killer
leg workout, 160kg clean. Guys were crazy, but it's nice exploring new workout
routines.</p>

<p>Work was awesome. Pretty much all day spent with A. on C++ problems and
changes. And we again did fair amount of work which is always great! We talked
about gym as well and she might take me to see the CERN gym. We can surely talk
more gym later. We seem to get on well.</p>

<p>Also was to see the ATLAS experiment on Friday. Great presentation to actually
understand what happens inside of it. But in comparison with CMS a bit
underwhelming. CMS was just so cool that you could actually see inside of it.
BUT there was a rubber duck inside of the control room (<em>TODO:pics!</em>)
There we met with a few people around my age that also do technical
studentships and are mainly into IT. And I think I have pretty great position!
All the other guys seemed a bit fed up with their mundane tasks, which have no
clear results. It feels kind of special for everyone that I actually am in an
experiment group with experimental physicists.</p>

<p>TODAY (Saturday) was quite lazy for most of the day and then I went for a trip
to Migros in Thoiry. Didn't buy almost anything and spent there like an hour
just to go through everything while talking with mum :D That was great.</p>

<p>I did some accounting for the past 20 or so days that I have been here. And it
seems like that I'm gonna be fine with the money. I spent a bit more than what
would be usual for my normal month (I think) and I'm still well under the
budget üíµ.</p>

<p>I searched for some golf courses and it seems like there are few really
affordable. I gotta get my clubs here and practice and play! That would be
amazing! Having like 10-15 rounds of golf during this trip?? JUST IMAGINE.</p>

<p>Finished my day with wraps and <strong>Sisu</strong> :D The most bloody movie I've seen in a
while in which the main character says like two sentences. That was something
else.</p>

<h3>2024-01-28 18:12</h3>

<p>Loundry is done! Hate it! Struggled to figure everything out as there is
nothing in english... But made it work and blacks are black and smelling good!</p>

<p>Gotta get dinner soon, wanna look at the CERN golf club when I now know a bit
more how everything works. Pretty excited about the golf courses that are
around so would be great to get the clubs here. And want to look at raymarching
in GPUs for possible raymarching project.</p>

<h3>2024-01-30 00:15</h3>

<p>Another Monday! The day went away so quick! I did almost nothing and still was
productive the whole time. Weird days! Went to visit the <strong>N<em>TOF</strong> facility
with other ISOLDE people. I'm not one of the nuclear physicists so it wasn't
aimed at me that much, BUT I think that I saw what F.Mraz was telling me about
(TimePix something device -- calibration of beam and laser?? or something like
that from what I talked to the head of N</em>TOF... which is also crazy). Lab with
the most RP precautions I have seen to this point. Also this AL^26 story xD
Kekw</p>

<p>We tried to work on magnet with A. but we got a leak. Before that we saw a
correct signal so that was positive!</p>

<p>End of the day was quick. With a few french phrases from me, M., I. and A. :D</p>

<p>Plus gym (filled but ok... headphones dead :/).</p>

<p>There's a farmers strike tomorrow from 9 in the morning. I'm interested if I'm
gonna see some of them xD</p>

<p>Life is good
See you tomorrow!</p>

<h3>2024-01-30 19:21</h3>

<p>Tuesday! I'm still waiting for the PIN for my card. Hopefully that comes soon.
Spending more and more time in the 275 :D. The C++ is always trying to argue
but I've always managed to persuade it somehow. For some reason A. thought that
I'm staying for only 3 months, so got something like (<em>cannot you stay for more
than 3 months</em> -> <em>oh you are staying for six :D</em>). I'm really glad to be
useful to others.</p>

<p>LHCB next. Met Fatimah and Enrico together with other guys from the visit. It
was quite a tiny detector compared to the other ones (but the lowest I've been
-- -108m). Detector for only one side of the collision and the huge
<em>rotor</em>-looking thingy on the other side. CMS still rules as the best I would
say.</p>

<p>Lazy rest of the evening.</p>

<h3>2024-01-31 23:21</h3>

<p>A long night with gym ... deadlifts -- 180 without a belt, 170x3 without a
belt, felt really strong just having to focus on streangtening my back as much
as possible so it does not move! Not the greatest thing for power but I'm
gaining confidence in those lower weights.</p>

<p>Pizza (tuna with red onions -- never seen in CZ) + chicken now :P.</p>

<p>The working days are going so fast now! Every day I'm at least once in the lab.
So there's c++ always on the menu. We are starting to make it work. Major
unexpected problem with the fitting as the data was nowhere close to being fit
correctly. The data is just to dense. Main peak is around -3500 which is so
much further. Worked at the end tho. Plus almost all the python is now
transfered!</p>

<h3>2024-02-01 23:43</h3>

<p>These days I'm more in the lab than anywhere else. C++ is always throwing rocks
at you but we are fighting well and it's moving! I was <em>interrogated</em> by M.
about the progress and at the end of the day we showed her some of it. It
wasn't perfect, but seemed alright! </p>

<p>Also did some lighter leg workout... cos my legs are still burning from last
friday!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è! She's here in a minute! We called as pretty much
always and that's always nice to hear!</p>

<h3>2024-02-04 01:49</h3>

<p>Late saturday entry xD No entry from yesterday as I was expecting ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è and had
no time afterwards to write anything. Was really awesome to meet again! More
left for the memories...</p>

<p>Today we were lazy, had lunch, walked through most of the CERN and R1 and
our offices, seen everything outside of the Meyrin site at CERN, went to
Manor for coffee and visited the best light festival ever (Geneva Lux --
possibly the 10th). It has been great having her around again! Made dinner and
watched Your Name. Lovely movie.</p>

<p>Such a long Saturday! Loved that. Bit of a shopping and climbing tomorrow :).</p>

<h3>2024-02-05 08:43</h3>

<p>Monday morning! Nothing from yesterday so here I am. It's not that it would
have been super busy or anything like that. It was just great having her around
and I didn't spend any time at pc. We stayed in mostly, went shopping for a
bit, had great lunch and went to the Totem bouldering gym, which went very
well.</p>

<p>Today she took me to my work and we left it off there. See you soon, hopefully!</p>

<h3>2024-02-05 20:49</h3>

<p>Another Monday!! Lab work continues, but the stabilisation was running today!
So big improvement. They always come at the end of the day to keep me there
longer than I would like (but I like it). I know all of the c++ project now so
the work is actually so good on it. And I have ideas how to improve fitting
with some smoothing things... Gonna be great.</p>

<p>ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è arrived home! The weekend was something that I really needed! We started
watching One Piece yesterday and it is surprisingly great. I should probably
give more on others opinions about these shows! They are actually fine.</p>

<p>Wanna look into c++ RayMarching for a bit! Tomorrow probably fast shop and gym.
See you then!</p>

<h3>2024-02-07 00:07</h3>

<p>Tuesday done. Work had not much programming, but I was a plumber, a solderer, a
cleaner and a technical mover when we were moving and securing the magnet again
(and I did a bit of programming :P). TODO: FINALLY ADD SOME PICS FROM THE
WEEKEND SIGNAL FESTIVAL AND FROM THE MOVING.</p>

<p>Went for a gym and missed 100kg bench and hit 5x90 afterwards... wtf. Not
great, not terrible... I think I might go for a creatine tomorrow. It might
have some play in that as well. </p>

<p>Did a small shopping, mainly for meat. Got 2 packs, 1.6kg of chicken. Gonna
last three days at least on that xD.</p>

<p>And why am I writing so late??? I was cooking and met Armenian (I think) guys
(brothers... I think). And we spoke and spoke. Both learning english and french
at the same time. [Lufi] and [Abus] (31) are amazing! Drinking the whole time
but amazing xD 
- [Bon chance]
- [Bon courage]
- [a bianto] 
- [√©t√©] ... wtf is that language man ... summer
- [iver] (hiver) ... winter
- [moa] (mois) ... month
- [automne] ... autumn</p>

<p>My true first french lesson comes tomorrow.</p>

<h3>2024-02-07 10:01</h3>

<p>Finished all of my online lessons. Have to get safety stuff, dosimeter, and
full day RP/Electrical courses and we are done xD So much safety to do...</p>

<h3>2024-02-07 23:12</h3>

<p>First french lesson :D That's gonna be some fun. Guy speaks really a
french-english and french so it's like 50:50 foreign:foreign language lesson.
Which is awesome! Other than the obnoxious german guy, everything was amazing!</p>

<p>The work is slow now. There's not much to do on the magnet
because it does not work again. The water leaks fixes and subsequent
upgrades did not help much and actually made it worse for now. Hopefully it
gets better soon so we can see the stabilisation in action!</p>

<p>Gym felt good, back day, full of energy, good! 3 sets 90kg bentover rows. Felt
good.</p>

<p>Another long distance call and OnePiece!</p>

<p>Also my YoungLa stuff came this morning! Gonna get them tomorrow (<em>Clothing
show tomorrow? :P</em>).</p>

<h3>2024-02-09 00:16</h3>

<p>Hey I got my new gym gear! YoungLA is freaking goated. Everything fits
perfectly (<em>for my own liking</em>). And the double layered shorts! Goated.</p>

<p>Work was feeling slow today, but killed time with website (<em>filling up profile
pics with xkcd memes xD</em>). Preparing all of the content already. Probably gonna
spend tomorrow with it as well. Also, wanna get my dosimeter tomorrow morning.
ANd hopefully find some spot for earlier RP course than 2nd of April xD.</p>

<p>Ended the day with another OnePiece and some french.</p>

<p>And probably late gym tomorrow if I may guess. See you then! Bye.</p>

<h3>2024-02-10 00:21</h3>

<p>Long day but just a quick one. I was fortunate enough to land a spot on a trip
to Ostenensee (<em>maybe</em>) with a couple of other guys! BUT it's really ealry in
the morning... Sooo gotta hit bed asap. </p>

<p>Work was weird! Magnet worked, then everything worked, then motor started doing
weird things... nwm, I thought I knew the solution... lunch and the spectrum is
nowhere to be found!!! Got my dosimeter today tho!</p>

<p>French... man who designed the numbering system. above 60 it's sum... above 80
it's partly multiplication WTF! Language sounds great tho and I love to add new
phrases to our convos with Lufi (<em>he's probably gonna be the king of the
pirates</em> xD).</p>

<p>I did a leg day today! With my new belt and shorts!!! Ohh I love those! 150kg
squat, 140x3 easily. Felt alright! Met this guy whose name I can't come up with
atm, super amazing english, great squats. 55 year old english teacher in
Geneva, absolute beast! Sporty, did squats with like 105/110, then went to
bench 3x5 100kg pretty much close grip bench like fuck yeah! Gotta talk to him
more! Also had a silent, distant moment with an gorg asian girl when we crossed
paths at CERN in the evening. Guys were going out and I was returning for my
bike. With the size of this thing, I'm probably not gonna see many guys more
than once xD Probably should talk to everyone interesting the first chance I
got.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow! Gotta wake up so early!</p>

<h3>2024-02-11 18:46</h3>

<p>Sunday, nothing yesterday as I was happy to be happy. Woke up super early to
meet 4 other guys at Carrefour and go to see on really really snowy adventure.
Nice hike although we could have gone a bit further (<em>batter safe than
sorry</em>). </p>

<p>Today I took my window blinders fully down, so I slept till like 10:30 with no
problem xD did laundry, looked at french stuff, played arround with CUDA (<em>need
to find some sample projects for cuda opengl interopt</em>). Pretty nice calm day.</p>

<p>Played a bit of Shapez and got hooked on overoptimizing everything xD Not a
game for me probably... 
For some reason, I'm getting insecure feelings about stuff... but probably
that's just my weekend brain going over the allowed limit of thinking time...
I'm planning a small surprise for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>

<h3>2024-02-12 22:23</h3>

<p>Monday! These always go away so fast xD Morning meeting with M. on zoom was fun
xD Bit of talk about github, lunch and solving problems with magnet. (<em>The
spectrum is shit... btw it's there</em>...). French was good but spent some more
time in lab while we were solving the magnet problem (Mik f-ed up probably and
ruined one of the pulse generators :D). Should be fixed and looked quite good
already!</p>

<p>Finally joined RP course (8 hours), and I'm doing electrical course tomorrow!
Gonna be interesting!</p>

<p>Hit gym, was really strong again! 100kg bench good, 37.5 for bunch of reps and
sets like nothing!</p>

<h3>2024-02-13 22:13</h3>

<p>Tusday was fine. The magnet is working again!! So the work begins...
unfortunately the serial connection on the arduino motor is shitty and there's
some work to be done with it. I'm probably sinking a few days into it.</p>

<p>Other than that I went shopping and had a lazy evening with a bit of reaserch
to cuda stuff and <em>Full Swing</em> videos. </p>

<h3>2024-02-15 00:20</h3>

<p>Valentine's day! Everything arrived well :) Glad to make her happy with small
things like that! Was waiting till 4pm. the whole day... so the day went by
fast! We finished the live action One Piece xD Onto the anime now... xD</p>

<p>French was interesting and I feel like I'm slowly getting into it! I'm surely
not the best there. There are guys with latin knowledge and much better
pronunciation (I think with some french background too). But I'm getting the
words in! Trying to get some lessons every other day so I see it every day.</p>

<p>At work, arduino motor is killing me, I made some progress but it's the only
weird serial comm which doesn't want to behave. There are a few things to test
so I always have something to try! Other than that, we were able to run the
stabilisation so progress!</p>

<h3>2024-02-15 23:13</h3>

<p>Back was really exhausted from last nights gym - deadlifts and more. So I'm
staying at home, cooking and being lazy. I found some interesting Cuda+OpenGL projects
so I might try to work with them.</p>

<p>I love how often I get to call with everyone! ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è pretty much every day these
days!</p>

<p>Achievements at work! Stabilization ran for the first time for a long long
time. We are in area of just fixing corner cases, which break the comm once in
a while (haven't happened in a while). The arduino sucks, but we are handeling
it! Lovely encounter with Nik. yesterday when we got blame for him
disconnecting his own under current cables. It is a great fun with A. these
days! Had birthday yesterday so seemed under the weather xD It was a fun day!</p>
