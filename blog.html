<p>It's the start of the blog, yaay!</p>

<p>How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.</p>

<h3>2024-01-06 21:36</h3>

<p>Everything is crazy, homesick at home yet I wanna leave so bad! Tomorrow big
time! (<em>added Spotify links, songs everywhere! Good job past me</em>)</p>

<p>üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (<em>glad for Eva</em>). Room needs small improvements (<em>bigger
ones wouldn't fit</em>). </p>

<p>Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? </p>

<ol>
<li>How is everyone going to be.</li>
<li>How lost am I going to be.</li>
<li>I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.</li>
<li>What is the golf course like! :D</li>
</ol>

<p>Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!</p>

<p>What a long day ha! </p>

<p>8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).</p>

<p>Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with A. the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. </p>

<p>Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, M. showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.</p>

<p>Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (<em>some state of the art
html source</em>). And some simpler Python thingies.</p>

<p>Hey there! Bunch of mails done today, M. is pouring info and there's still more
to go. Went to the 275 lab this morning, saw mountains for pretty much the
first time (<em>the view is much much better than what I expected</em>). Had small
debugging session with A., had zoom calls about bunch of guys speaking
french..., lunch and more debugging. </p>

<p>A. gave me access to the <strong>universe</strong> amount of data (<em>like wtf is in 19PB of
experimental data and WHY THE FUCK is it in single folder somewhere AND WTF AM
I DOING WITH ACCESS TO IT IN CLOUD!!!</em> ... like, I'm not touching anything but
just saying). </p>

<p>Did some search for the problem, helped to solve it finally after she was stuck
on it for weeks probs. God I hope I'm gonna be useful here (that felt nice)!
She's probably gonna let me fiddle around with much more from that one so I
should try to read up on electromagnets lul.</p>

<p>About hour more and home we go.</p>

<p>Also... got mail from M. that we are advised to go home and work remotely
because of the snow :D Interesting.</p>

<p>Also this is playing on repeat :D</p>
