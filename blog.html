<h3>2024-01-05 13:32</h3>

<p>It's the start of the blog, yaay!</p>

<p>How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.</p>

<h3>2024-01-06 21:36</h3>

<p>Everything is crazy, homesick at home yet I wanna leave so bad! Tomorrow big
time! (<em>added Spotify links, songs everywhere! Good job past me</em>)</p>

<h3>2024-01-07 21:09</h3>

<p>üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (<em>glad for Eva</em>). Room needs small improvements (<em>bigger
ones wouldn't fit</em>). </p>

<p>Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? </p>

<ol>
<li>How is everyone going to be.</li>
<li>How lost am I going to be.</li>
<li>I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.</li>
<li>What is the golf course like! :D</li>
</ol>

<p>Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!</p>

<h3>2024-01-08 20:56</h3>

<p>What a long day ha! </p>

<p>8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).</p>

<p>Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with Amy the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. </p>

<p>Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, Magda showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.</p>

<p>Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (<em>some state of the art
html source</em>). And some simpler Python thingies.</p>

<h3>2024-01-09 16:12</h3>

<p>Hey there! Bunch of mails done today, M. is pouring info and there's still more
to go. Went to the 275 lab this morning, saw mountains for pretty much the
first time (<em>the view is much much better than what I expected</em>). Had small
debugging session with A., had zoom calls about bunch of guys speaking
french..., lunch and more debugging. </p>

<p>A. gave me access to the <strong>universe</strong> amount of data (<em>like wtf is in 19PB of
experimental data and WHY THE FUCK is it in single folder somewhere AND WTF AM
I DOING WITH ACCESS TO IT IN CLOUD!!!</em> ... like, I'm not touching anything but
just saying). </p>

<p>Did some search for the problem, helped to solve it finally after she was stuck
on it for weeks probs. God I hope I'm gonna be useful here (that felt nice)!
She's probably gonna let me fiddle around with much more from that one so I
should try to read up on electromagnets lul.</p>

<p>About hour more and home we go.</p>

<p>Also... got mail from M. that we are advised to go home and work remotely
because of the snow :D Interesting.</p>

<p>Also this is playing on repeat :D</p>

<h3>2024-01-09 23:22</h3>

<p>Well I wanted to go working out to Bushido Gym. Such a nice place and the guy
does only 1on1 sessions. Bummer. Gotta get on the bike thing tomorrow (not
literally yet). </p>

<p>Looks like I'm gonna be learning javascript for web dev project. So even this
website might get a facelift who knows.</p>

<p>Well GN and let's try for a gym tomorrow after work!</p>

<h3>2024-01-10 23:53</h3>

<p>Good evening! Day pretty much successful. I am pretty active in helping A. with
the project. And she's having problems with such basic stuff (not meant bad,
she is not supposed to do better, she did great already with the amount that
she has written). But I feel like I could help more. Still feels good that I
can solve whatever she throws at me.</p>

<p>I was told that I might be able to participate during some of the ZULF
experiments if there is gonna be python shenanigans happening! That would mean
going to the Geneva hospital and doing something around their own small
accelerator!! Cool!</p>

<p>Started working on the website. Pain. Gonna continue tomorrow.</p>

<p>First time visiting the gym here! Gotta search for another one, because this
one costs a lot (25 CHF per visit/125 I think per month). Could do montly, but
would probably be better to look elsewhere too. Did chest, 100 bench 2x, 1x,
bunch of 90, 80. NOBODY KNOWS ANY ENGLISH, WTF!!! Was spotting the younger guy
who spoke only french. Like cmon learn some english as well, what are you
doing. Was happy with how it went tho.</p>

<p>Shower + Sleep! Cy@</p>

<h3>2024-01-11 23:33</h3>

<p>Day that went away quite quick! Work was great, I'm useful there and there are
more projects to come.</p>

<p>Spending time with A. on the project, I would like to help more but not forcing
anything. I mean it's still a project that funds everything that she does here.
So surely she wants to work on it by itself.</p>

<p>WTF that powerlifting belt. There were some visible hints but that's so cool!
Gonna have to try the CERN gym xD</p>

<p>P.S. Don't try the burger again! It's really not worth the money.</p>

<h3>2024-01-12 22:50</h3>

<p>First friday, first weekend incoming. The week went by super fast. Spent the
day struggling with the website kinda, but got a lot of progress in. I would
just hope to code it up all by myself. But first reactions were nice. Got the
<em>views</em> going at the end so it now seems like I know what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Have seen the french mountains clearly for the first time!</p>

<p>Great to talk to that Netherlands guys. Also Monika was one to talk to as well.
Probably gonna work with her more during the Vito web dev. Also stoked about
the next task (hopefully CERN approves it - learning JavaScript gonna be
interesting but not as hard I think).</p>

<p>I was the luckiest, late registering for the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330090/">BBC podcast
event</a> and was able tob participate!
What a lucky thing, like 800 people with really well known faces in the front.
And most of the audience were CERN guys xD That's some audience as well (I
really gotta get my own trip to the LHC done, because that would be a shame not
actually seeing the big stuff). </p>

<p>Adding some images from the podcast event and on my way home: (also the gallery
idea is not really bad - could use the slick library I found out about)</p>
