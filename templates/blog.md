It's the start of the blog, yaay!

How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.

üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (*glad for Eva*). Room needs small improvements (*bigger
ones wouldn't fit*). 

Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? 

1. How is everyone going to be.
2. How lost am I going to be.
3. I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.
4. What is the golf course like! :D

Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!

What a long day ha! 

8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).

Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with A. the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. 

Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, M. showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.

Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (*some state of the art
html source*). And some simpler Python thingies.
