It's the start of the blog, yaay!

How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.

### 2024-01-06 21:36
Everything is crazy, homesick at home yet I wanna leave so bad! Tomorrow big
time! (*added Spotify links, songs everywhere! Good job past me*)

üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (*glad for Eva*). Room needs small improvements (*bigger
ones wouldn't fit*). 

Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? 

1. How is everyone going to be.
2. How lost am I going to be.
3. I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.
4. What is the golf course like! :D

Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!

What a long day ha! 

8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).

Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with Amy the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. 

Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, Magda showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.

Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (*some state of the art
html source*). And some simpler Python thingies.

Hey there! Bunch of mails done today, M. is pouring info and there's still more
to go. Went to the 275 lab this morning, saw mountains for pretty much the
first time (*the view is much much better than what I expected*). Had small
debugging session with A., had zoom calls about bunch of guys speaking
french..., lunch and more debugging. 

A. gave me access to the **universe** amount of data (*like wtf is in 19PB of
experimental data and WHY THE FUCK is it in single folder somewhere AND WTF AM
I DOING WITH ACCESS TO IT IN CLOUD!!!* ... like, I'm not touching anything but
just saying). 

Did some search for the problem, helped to solve it finally after she was stuck
on it for weeks probs. God I hope I'm gonna be useful here (that felt nice)!
She's probably gonna let me fiddle around with much more from that one so I
should try to read up on electromagnets lul.

About hour more and home we go.

Also... got mail from M. that we are advised to go home and work remotely
because of the snow :D Interesting.

Also this is playing on repeat :D

### 2024-01-09 23:22

Well I wanted to go working out to Bushido Gym. Such a nice place and the guy
does only 1on1 sessions. Bummer. Gotta get on the bike thing tomorrow (not
literally yet). 

Looks like I'm gonna be learning javascript for web dev project. So even this
website might get a facelift who knows.

Well GN and let's try for a gym tomorrow after work!

### 2024-01-10 23:53

Good evening! Day pretty much successful. I am pretty active in helping A. with
the project. And she's having problems with such basic stuff (not meant bad,
she is not supposed to do better, she did great already with the amount that
she has written). But I feel like I could help more. Still feels good that I
can solve whatever she throws at me.

I was told that I might be able to participate during some of the ZULF
experiments if there is gonna be python shenanigans happening! That would mean
going to the Geneva hospital and doing something around their own small
accelerator!! Cool!

Started working on the website. Pain. Gonna continue tomorrow.

First time visiting the gym here! Gotta search for another one, because this
one costs a lot (25 CHF per visit/125 I think per month). Could do montly, but
would probably be better to look elsewhere too. Did chest, 100 bench 2x, 1x,
bunch of 90, 80. NOBODY KNOWS ANY ENGLISH, WTF!!! Was spotting the younger guy
who spoke only french. Like cmon learn some english as well, what are you
doing. Was happy with how it went tho.

Shower + Sleep! Cy@

### 2024-01-11 23:33

Day that went away quite quick! Work was great, I'm useful there and there are
more projects to come.

Spending time with A. on the project, I would like to help more but not forcing
anything. I mean it's still a project that funds everything that she does here.
So surely she wants to work on it by itself.

WTF that powerlifting belt. There were some visible hints but that's so cool!
Gonna have to try the CERN gym xD

P.S. Don't try the burger again! It's really not worth the money.

### 2024-01-12 22:50

First friday, first weekend incoming. The week went by super fast. Spent the
day struggling with the website kinda, but got a lot of progress in. I would
just hope to code it up all by myself. But first reactions were nice. Got the
*views* going at the end so it now seems like I know what I'm doing. Found out
that A. had the phd done in Oxford from what it looks like, just wow.

Have seen the french mountains clearly for the first time!

Great to talk to that Netherlands guys. Also Monika was one to talk to as well.
Probably gonna work with her more during the Vito web dev. Also stoked about
the next task (hopefully CERN approves it - learning JavaScript gonna be
interesting but not as hard I think).

I was the luckiest, late registering for the [BBC podcast
event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330090/) and was able tob participate!
What a lucky thing, like 800 people with really well known faces in the front.
And most of the audience were CERN guys xD That's some audience as well (I
really gotta get my own trip to the LHC done, because that would be a shame not
actually seeing the big stuff). 

Adding some images from the podcast event and on my way home: (also the gallery
idea is not really bad - could use the slick library I found out about)

First saturday, first walk through Geneva, first shopping madness at the end of
work day in coop. Geneva was cosy, not big, walkable. French is everywhere!
People actually don't know much english. I started doing french duolingo course
xD. Tried going to the Saint-Genis gym. Man they should really know a bit of
english everywhere... 

Geneva was nice, look at some of the nice images.

Sunday is about trying to find suitable gym. I already know about a boulder gym
and that is gonna be a plan for sometimes next week probably. We'll see what's
the program. Also I should look at those indico events, because there might be
something interesting that I'm missing.

### 2024-01-14 18:40
 
Soo no workout today, weird membership rules so a new member cannot go anywhere
just to try it once. Swiss people actually don't work on weekends.
But I was fortunate enough to have a **bouldering gym** pretty close in Geneva.
And that's gonna be a great place where to spend some time (even on Sundays!).
Light blues and one dark blue done today. Although I was getting embarassed by
climbing kids as always. Talked a bit to these two in CERN student girls and
they were great. One was getting seriously close to embarassing my climbing
too. But luckily I showed off well.

Not gonna work much more today. Will get a dinner in. And probably look at some
javascript thingy so I know what I'm getting myself into or I try to look for
some ways how to try and solve the ssh connection task.

Also I saw mountains on both sides for the first time! What a moment. The area
is much mountain-y than what I've expected.

### 2024-01-16 00:10

Hey there. Just one late entry before the bed. Had my first monday report
today. Felt like I was looking for words but it went ok. A. is giving me more
programming tasks. 

I became the master of cernoverride theme and hence the master of css. The site
is gonna look good! I never knew the strenght of nautilus mounting. 

Also went for the Bladonet nonstop gym and that's probably gonna be the gym to
stay in. My legs are so sore! 140 squats without belt for twos. Felt really
good. Place bit crowded but it never really stopped me from doing my stuff.

### 2024-01-16 15:55

This day takes so long, maybe because I'm basically alone here. Meeting is
coming up shortly. I've done some good work today, the DB is waiting for
approval, been running around asking questions and making stuff done. Will
finish the day with looking at c++ resources for A.

### 2024-01-16 23:21

OK so the meeting was really something. It was a safety meeting mainly because
of the fiery 24/10 incident with Ita. girl (the name of whom I'm still missing). 
It looked rough for everyone because of the safety procedure changes that have
to happen. It didn't sound that unreasonable, but I can imagine that those
clever minds can think of something just on the spot (*just as I do while
working*) that really has to be done in the moment and this kinda sabotages
their work.

Hopefully they get together to generate something that helps everyone and
doesn't threaten ISOLDE anymore.

Lidl shopping is goated. First chicken breasts today xD. Loved that. Would use
some more cutlery, but I managed.

### 2024-01-18 00:41

An interesting day. I was pretty useful, almost finishing the N. visualizer
project. Ending the day with actual python script generating real time data for
the DB and visualizer working as intended. Probably gonna implement it
tomorrow.

In next few days, I'm gonna talk to M. about the website so I'm a bit nervous
but I think we will manage together.

I really like how much I need to go around and communicate with others, because
I always feel like I know only half of the needed informations. And it's kinda
like a game, figuring out all the necessary pieces to put together. Real team
work feeling kinda. 

I opened my SWISS BANK ACCOUNT üá®üá≠ today! What a weird student's life this is.
This is like a whole adventure. I'm glad that I'm keeping up with this blog.

Finished my day with gym, chest day. I kept my strength mostly. Why are there
only 37.5kg dumbbells in the gym. I was already repping that. We'll have to do
some harder exercises with those ones. Other than that, I looked PEELED AF.

### 2024-01-18 13:08

Afterlunch one. Tasks flying, zoned out with the website, N. comes in with
Python requests. Still making improvements on website. Now gotta prepare the
final version of everything for visualizer. It's like a game. Need to *minmax*
all of it.

Started talking a lot with most of the guys at lunch. Feels like I'm slowly
getting tag of the *regular* one and kinda a part of team member.
