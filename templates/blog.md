It's the start of the blog, yaay!

How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.

üá®üá≠Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (*glad for Eva*). Room needs small improvements (*bigger
ones wouldn't fit*). 

Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? 

1. How is everyone going to be.
2. How lost am I going to be.
3. I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.
4. What is the golf course like! :D

Glad for ü¶Ü‚ù§Ô∏è for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!
